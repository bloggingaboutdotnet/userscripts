Various userscripts

- Add title to questions on the front page of Stack Exchange sites
  - The Questions that are shown on the front page of any Stack Exchange site, for example [Meta Stack Exchange](https://meta.stackexchange.com/) used to have their title attribute on the anchors populated with a small excerpt of the post. Due to peformance reasons this is no longr the case. The Add Title script restores that functionality.
